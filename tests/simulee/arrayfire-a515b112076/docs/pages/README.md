## About ArrayFire

ArrayFire is a high performance software library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. Its array based function set makes parallel programming more accessible.

You can get ArrayFire in one of the following ways
    * [Binary installers](http://arrayfire.com/download/) from our download page
    * Build from source using our [github repo](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire)

## Easy to use

The [array](\ref construct_mat) object is beautifully simple.

Array-based notation effectively expresses computational algorithms in
readable math-resembling notation. You _do not_ need expertise in
parallel programming to use ArrayFire.

A few lines of ArrayFire code
accomplishes what can take 100s of complicated lines in CUDA or OpenCL
kernels.

## ArrayFire is extensive!

#### Support for multiple domains

ArrayFire contains [hundreds of functions](\ref arrayfire_func) across various domains including:
- [Vector Algorithms](\ref vector_mat)
- [Image Processing](\ref image_mat)
- [Computer Vision](\ref cv_mat)
- [Signal Processing](\ref signal_mat)
- [Linear Algebra](\ref linalg_mat)
- [Statistics](\ref stats_mat)
- and more.

Each function is hand-tuned by ArrayFire
developers with all possible low-level optimizations.

#### Support for various data types and sizes

ArrayFire operates on common [data shapes and sizes](\ref indexing),
including vectors, matrices, volumes, and

It supports common [data types](\ref gettingstarted_datatypes),
including single and double precision floating
point values, complex numbers, booleans, and 32-bit signed and
unsigned integers.

#### Extending ArrayFire

ArrayFire can be used as a stand-alone application or integrated with
existing CUDA or OpenCL code. All ArrayFire `arrays` can be
interchanged with other CUDA or OpenCL data structures.

## Code once, run anywhere!

With support for x86, ARM, CUDA, and OpenCL devices, ArrayFire supports for a comprehensive list of devices.

Each ArrayFire installation comes with:
 - a CUDA version (named 'libafcuda') for [NVIDIA
 GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus),
 - an OpenCL version (named 'libafopencl') for [OpenCL devices](http://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products#opencl)
 - a CPU version (named 'libafcpu') to fall back to when CUDA or OpenCL devices are not available.

## ArrayFire is highly efficient

#### Vectorized and Batched Operations

ArrayFire supports batched operations on N-dimensional arrays.
Batch operations in ArrayFire are run in parallel ensuring an optimal usage of your CUDA or OpenCL device.

You can get the best performance out of ArrayFire using [vectorization techniques]().

ArrayFire can also execute loop iterations in parallel with
[the gfor function](\ref gfor).

#### Just in Time compilation

ArrayFire performs run-time analysis of your code to increase
arithmetic intensity and memory throughput, while avoiding unnecessary
temporary allocations. It has an awesome internal JIT compiler to make
optimizations for you.

## Simple Example

Here's a live example to let you see ArrayFire code. You create [arrays](\ref
construct_mat) which reside on CUDA or OpenCL devices. Then you can use
[ArrayFire functions](modules.htm) on those [arrays](\ref construct_mat).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// sample 40 million points on the GPU
array x = randu(20e6), y = randu(20e6);
array dist = sqrt(x * x + y * y);

// pi is ratio of how many fell in the unit circle
float num_inside = sum<float>(dist < 1);
float pi = 4.0 * num_inside / 20e6;
af_print(pi);
